# Analysis of Failed Banks

This project aims to perform an analysis on failed banks using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The purpose is to analyze the factors contributing to bank failures and gain insights from the available data. The code for this project will be continuously updated as we make progress and discover new findings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about failed banks. It includes various attributes such as bank name, location, financial indicators, regulatory details, and more. The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of failed banks and serves as a valuable resource for our analysis.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore the dataset and uncover patterns, trends, and potential factors that contribute to bank failures. By conducting a thorough analysis, we aim to gain insights into the underlying causes and identify any commonalities among failed banks. These findings can aid in understanding the banking industry and potentially assist in preventing future failures.

## Methodology

The analysis will be performed using Python programming language and various data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. We will utilize statistical techniques, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis to examine the dataset and extract meaningful information.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset obtained from Kaggle.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- `results/`: This directory will store any generated outputs, reports, or visualizations.
- `src/`: This directory includes any additional source code or utility functions used in the project.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for running the code.
